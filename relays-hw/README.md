# Relays hardware

This project contains the hardware design for the controllers using relays.

All [libraries](libraries), [footprints](footprints) and [3D models](packages3d) (a part from the standard ones comming with Kicad) have been included in the project to avoid missing dependencies in the future.

I also include [plots](plots) for the board in case you just want to start building one without having to deal with Kicad.
