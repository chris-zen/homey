# Temperature and Humidity sensor

## Overview

This is a portable device that will allow:

- to monitor the temperature and humidity wherever it is positioned and report to an MQTT broker
- to show the parameters through an OLED screen (stretch goal)
- to intercept other sensors parameters and show them on the screen (like an external temperature and humidity sensor) (stretch goal)
- to configure the heater controller (stretch goal)
