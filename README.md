# My Smart Home

This is my second round to build devices for my Smart Home (see [this other project](https://github.com/chris-zen/energy-monitoring) for my first try).

I am currently planning to build the following controllers:
- **Blinds controller**: To bring up and down the blinds remotely.
- **Thermostat controller**: To switch on/off my heater according to the desired temperature.
- **Bathroom extractor controller**: To control the air extraction from the bathroom according to the humidity and certain time restrictions.

This time I will use ESP8266 and Mongoose-OS as the base for the controllers.
The setup for the base station will be very similar to that of my first project (see [this](https://github.com/chris-zen/energy-monitoring/wiki/Base-station) for further information).
