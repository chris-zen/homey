This is my second round to build devices for my Smart Home (see [this](https://github.com/chris-zen/homey) for the first round).

Currently planning to build the following controllers:
- Blinds controller: To bring up/down the blinds remotely.
- Thermostat controller: To switch on/off my heater according to the desired temperature.
- Bathroom extractor controller: To control the air extraction by humidity and time.

This time I will use ESP8266 and Mongoose-OS as the base for the controllers.
The setup for the main brain will be very similar to that of my first attempt (more info [here](https://github.com/chris-zen/energy-monitoring/wiki/Base-station))
